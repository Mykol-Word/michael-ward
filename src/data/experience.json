    "description": "At Flight Works, I developed space-grade embedded C firmware. I can't say much specifically, but I can say I learned a lot about embedded programming with resource constraints and contributing to a much larger and moving codebase than I'm used to. One such project I worked on was an ASCENT-based Propulsion Unit with Modular Applications (PUMA) which you can read more about from the link above.",

    "date": "April 2024 – June 2025",
    "description": "I co-led the Micromouse at UCLA program, mentoring over 80 students in designing and building autonomous maze-solving robots. As part of my work, I created 6 assignments and delivered lectures on motor & encoders, PID controllers, maze-solving algorithms, and IR sensors. I also conducted lots of schematic/PCB design reviews and in-lab worksessions. Overall I had a great experience!"
